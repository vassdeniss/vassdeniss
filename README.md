# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ
My name is Denis Vasilev - Junior Developer and Graphic Designer! 

I'm from Bulgaria and currently in the 12th grade as of 2021/2022 studying graphic design and technologies. 

## ðŸ“— Hobbies 
I've been studying graphic design for 4 years now and computer science for one year. 

Personally I find programming more fun than graphic design and that's what I am prioritising. I love reading and learning about all things technology everyday. 

In my free time I love to play a lot of games, program on some small projects, solving puzzles or reading a book. Fun fact! My favourite color is orange! I also like green and red. My birthdate is 6th of October.

Currently a student at [Software University](https://softuni.bg/) and in active courses:

Also learning a little bit of everything in my free time like Unity, Android Development or whatever looks interesting :D

During my middle school learning program I've studied different technologies whether they're coding / markup languages or frameworks / libraries.
I've also studied some other languages / libraries in my own free time out of pure curiosity.

| Coding Languages | Markup Languages | Framewoks / Libraries |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| C#               | HTML             | Bootstrap             |
| JavaScript       | CSS              | jQuery                |
| Java             | Razor            | Discord.js            |

Also in my free time I've been curious about these languages and frameworks / libraries too but have not gotten down to learning them.

| Coding Languages | Framewoks / Libraries |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| C                | Tailwind              |
| C++              | AlphineJs             |
| Python           | Discord.js            |
| Rust             |                       |

## ðŸ’» Projects 
Some of my projects (finished or unfinished) are already here on my github page, so feel free to take a look! 

I've worked on many small projects for fun or just for practicing my skills in a language. I've made apps, a few games, bots and mostly websites.

There are a lot of things I want to work on and there are a lot of things I want to learn, I am taking things slowly there is always going to be time to study.
